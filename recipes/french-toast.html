    <h2>Toast but like French</h2>
    <p>Wake up to an irresistibly delicious breakfast that's super quick and easy to whip up using a few basic ingredients you likely already have in your kitchen. This French toast recipe soaks thick slices of bread in a mixture of milk, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and an egg before tossing each slice in a frying pan. Fluffy and tender on the inside and perfectly golden-brown on the outside, making French toast is one of our favorite — and most indulgent! — breakfast dishes.</p>
